# Hangman_Game
Welcome to Hangman game. 🎮🌠
The window has the resolution of 1920x1080.🖥
The images 🌃 for this game are made by me, using the characters and templates from PowerPoint. I edited them in GIMP. 
There is a menu at the top left, from where you can exit the game, you can choose the new word from a specific category and you can find out more abot this game. 🗃

From the button 'new game’, a new word will be displayed and you have to guess it. Next to it, there are three buttons.    
  1. One is for stopping the game and displaying the word.    
  2. Another one is for pausing the game. A new window will open. There are balls moving around and meanwhile you can take a break. The time will stop and you can make a cup of tea. ☕️ This game was also made during the labs. I adapted it to my game.    
  3. The third button is for cheating. When you press it, a snake game 🐍 will appear in a new window and you have to find the food. After eating the food 🍔, the window will be closed and you have unlimited time to guess the word. This game was also made during the labs. I adapted it to my game. 
  
A label with the timing is in the bottom(middle) of the screen. The game has three levels:     
  1. At the beginning the time will be 2 minutes.    
  2. After guessing 4 words, the time will be 1 minute.    
  3. After guessing 10 words, you will have just 30 seconds/word.
  
If you don't guess the word and time's up, a warning will pop up and you won’t have time anymore for guessing the word. ⏰

There is also a label with the scoring mechanism in the top left. 🔝In the bottom right you have 2 buttons and a label.     
  1. The first button will exit the main window and you will be able to save your name and the score. You can also have a look on the leaderboard.
  2. The second button you can access during the game and it shows you all the players, their score and the position. 🥇🥈🥉🏆   
  3. The label 'Boss key' ▶ will pop up a new window, where I made a screenshot of a word document. In this way, if you are at work, you can press 'right Key'(right arrow) and the boss won't know that you are playing. 💼
  
Above this, there are the images, which will change if you do not guess a letter. Be careful, that if you want to start a new game, during another one or you stop the game, the images won't start from the beginning. So, don't cheat. 👩‍💻
In the middle you have the label with the word 💬 and the buttons, which become inactive after pressing them. This happens at every new game.
